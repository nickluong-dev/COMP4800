## About
**Note: Code is unavailable for view due to signed NDA**

This was a 12-week industry sponsored project partnered with my school. This project was completed in a team of 5 developers.
Our client wanted to digitize their manual method of inputting and managing client data. Having previously used Excel Spreadsheets to store records, our team designed a webapp that allowed lab technicians login/signup and input data through a front-end, storing records into a database. Users could also edit past records and visualize aggregate data.
