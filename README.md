## About
**Note: Code is unavailable for view due to signed NDA**

This was a 12-week industry sponsored project partnered with my school. This project was completed in a team of 5 developers.
Our client wanted to digitize their manual method of inputting and managing client data. Having previously used Excel Spreadsheets to store records, our team designed a webapp that allowed lab technicians login/signup and input data through a front-end, storing records into a database. Users could also edit past records and visualize aggregate data. 

## My Contributions
- Designed and implemented relational database solution to store client data and handle queries on the back-end
- Used Figma to design mockups for client approval
- Integrated front-end forms to integrate with database and backend
- Created authentication features for secure login/signup
- Hosted on AWS for client demo usage
- Applied Agile workflow for continuous updates/deliverables
